# Codepressor

A script that will compress your code by **about 25%**!

# Usage

```python start.py my_code.js ```

# Supported programming languages

Tested on JavaScript, TypeScript, C++ and Java. It will work in most languages with similar syntax.
Python and Python-like (ex. Cython) languages is not supported yet, but I will be glad of your help!
